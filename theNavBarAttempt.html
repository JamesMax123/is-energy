    <h2>ENERGY is required to do work, simply put.
       It is a property that can be transferred, required for any sort of movement, and can take other forms.
       Its two main types are POTENTIAL ENERGY, which is stored energy, and KINETIC ENERGY,
       which is energy being used to do work.
        Energy is found wherever you go; you are even using energy as you read this sentence! And since energy can be found everywhere,
        it is contained in many things: </h2>
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong> Energy in TRANSIT </strong> - This is energy being transferred, in movement. This is more known as HEAT.
    As energy is everywhere, its transfer, heat, is also everywhere.
    You will learn about it as well as its methods of transfer, consequences of transfer,
    and its relation to temparature. <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong> Energy in WAVES </strong> - Waves are disturbances, or vibrations, moving through space in a periodic manner. These vibrations carry energy within them.
    You will learn the types of waves, their properties, and how they interact with the environment around them. <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong> Energy in CIRCUITS </strong> - Energy, since it can be converted to different forms, can come in the form of electricity. Electricity travels in circuits,
    carrying the energy in its movements. You will learn about the different types of circuits, their characteristics,
    and its interaction and conversion into other forms of energy. <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong> Energy in MATTER </strong> - Energy is contained in matter, which is basically everything. Even objects at rest carry potential energy,
    energy ready to get converted to work. You will learn about kinetic and potential energy, which includes the energy gravity lends, the Law of Conservation of Energy,
    the conversion of contained energy in matter to different forms, and its relation to heat. <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong> Energy in ORGANISMS </strong> - There are many processes in organisms, and to keep these processes going, you need energy.
    You will learn how the acquisition and utilization of energy is an important factor in life,
    as well as how energy is used in the different internal processes of living things.<br/><br/>
    <em>And some design to come later on...</em><br/><br/>
